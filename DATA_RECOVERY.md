## Summary

The last successful data export shows **no data** in any of the tables. This indicates either:
1. The database was freshly initialized and no data had been created yet
2. Data was cleared before the last export
3. The export occurred before any data was added

If you had data before this export, you may need to:
- Check for earlier backup files
- Look in browser storage/cache
- Check any manual exports you may have made

The database connection is currently failing, which may be preventing access to any newer data that was added after this export.
